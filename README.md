## MODULE 1 - The Basics

1. Given values **a**, **b** and **y** solve the following equation `(y + b) / (a - b)`, show the answer as output.

2. Given values **a** and **b** solve the following equation `(x + y) / 3`, show the answer as output.

3. Given values **a**, **b** and **c** solve the following equation `(c + b) * (3 - b) / 4^4`, show the answer as output.

4. Given the **height** and **width** of a rectangle, calculate and print on screen the area and perimeter of it `area = height * width; perimeter = 2 * (height + width)`.

5. Given **float** values **a** and **b** calculate their sum, substraction and multiplication, show the answer as output.

6. Given values **a**, **b**, **y** and **x** solve the equation `(x - y) / (3 * (a * b))`, show the answer as output.

7. Ask for the **value** of an item to the cashier and the **cash** amount that the buyer gave, show as answer how much **cash** needs to be given back to the buyer.

8. Ask for the **name**, **weight** (in tons) and **height** (in feet) of a dinosaur. Show as output it's name with the given **weight** (converted to kilograms) and it's **height** (converted to meters). `(1 ton = 1000 kg); (1 feet = 0.3047 m)`.

9. Convert the **price** in **liters** of machines in a fuel shop to **gallons** and calculate the **amount** to be paid by the customer in gallons. `(1L = $1.025) and (1Gallon = 3.785L)`.

10. Given values **a**, **b** and **c** solve the following equation `(a * (3 + b)) / (c *(3 - b))`, show the answer as output.

## MODULE 2 - Arrays, Iterators and Conditionals I

1. Given **5 califications** of a student, show Approved if it's **average** is at least 71 or Failed if
   it's average is below.

2. Given a employee's **worked hours**, **per hour salary** and **deductions** calculate it's net salary,
   depending on this raise by a defined percentage it's current base salary.

   - `net salary 1000 or less: 25% base salary raise`

   - `salary more than 1000 and up to 1500: 21% base salary raise`

   - `salary more than 1500: 18% base salary raise`

3. Given int values for **a** and **b** show as result the following values.

   - `100 * b if a = 1`

   - `100 + b if a = 2`

   - `100 / b if a = 3`

   - `0 if any other number`

4. Given int values of **a**, **b** and **c** show them in descendant order in screen.

5. Calculate the **cost** of a two ways plane ticket after asking the **distace** to be flown and how many **days** the passenger will be staying at it's destination hotel depending on the following criteria:

   - if staying more than 7 days and the flight to and from the destination combined is more than 800KMs,
     apply a 30% discount.

   - The price per KM is \$1.25

6. Give buyers a discount depending on the following criteria:

   - `Purchase amount < 500; discound = 0%`

   - `Purchase amount 500 >= and < 1000; discount = 5%`

   - `Purchase amount >= 1000; discount = 11%`

7. Given the **cost** of a vehicle and it's **brand**, calculate a discount based on the following table:

   - `toyota: 8%`

   - `suzuki: 10%`

   - `nissan: 12%`

   - `dodge: 15%`

8. Ask for the destination of a call and it's length to get to know the final cost based on this table:

   - `12: North Americas: $2.00/min`

   - `18: South Americas: $2.50/min`

   - `19: Europe: $3.00/min`

   - `23: Asia: $3.50/min`

   - `25: Africa: $4.00/min`

9. Convert the following measure units from - to as follow:

   - `1 inch = 25.40mm`

   - `1 yard = 0.9144M`

   - `1 mile = 1.6093KMs`

10. Calculate the cost per patient in a hospital, given their **discease** and **age** using the following params:

    - `if age > 14 and < 22; cost + 10%`

    - `type 1: $25/day`

    - `type 2: $16/day`

    - `type 3: $20/day`

    - `type 4: $32/day`

## Module 3 - Advanced Logic, Arrays and Iterators II

1. Print on screen the square and cube of the first 25 natural numbers.

2. Given a **int number**, calculate it's **factorial value**.
