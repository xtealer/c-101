## MODULE 1 - The Basics

1. Given values **a**, **b** and **y** solve the following equation `(y + b) / (a - b)`, show the answer as output.

2. Given values **a** and **b** solve the following equation `(x + y) / 3`, show the answer as output.

3. Given values **a**, **b** and **c** solve the following equation `(c + b) * (3 - b) / 4^4`, show the answer as output.

4. Given **height** and **width** of a rectangle, calculate and print on screen the area and perimeter of it `area = height * width; perimeter = 2 * (height + width)`.

5. Given **float** values **a** and **b** calculate their sum, substraction and multiplication, show the answer as output.

6. Given values **a**, **b**, **y** and **x** solve the equation `(x - y) / (3 * (a * b))`, show the answer as output.

7. Ask for the **value** of an item to the cashier and the **cash** amount that the buyer gave, show as answer how much **cash** needs to be given back to the buyer.

8. Ask for the **name**, **weight** (in tons) and **height** (in feet) of a dinosaur. Show as output it's name with the given **weight** (converted to kilograms) and it's **height** (converted to meters). `(1 ton = 1000 kg); (1 feet = 0.3047 m)`.

9. Convert the **price** in **liters** of machines in a fuel shop to **gallons** and calculate the **amount** to be paid by the customer in gallons. `(1L = $1.025) and (1Gallon = 3.785L)`.

10. Given values **a**, **b** and **c** solve the following equation `(a * (3 + b)) / (c *(3 - b))`, show the answer as output.
